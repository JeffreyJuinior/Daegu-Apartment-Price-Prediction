    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Daegu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu) is South Korea's third-largest urban agglomeration after Seoul and Busan, the third-largest official metropolitan area in the country with over 2.5 million residents and the second-largest city in the Yeongnam region in the southeastern Korean Peninsula after Busan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daegu was Korea's economic hub from the 1960s to the 1980s, and it was particularly well-known for its electronics industry. Daegu's humid subtropical climate is ideal for growing high-quality apples, hence the nickname \"Apple City.\" Daegu is also referred to as \"Textile City.\" Textiles were once the city's mainstay industry. Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.      \n",
    "        \n",
    "Because of Daegu's rapid development, the demand for apartment housing has increased. Daegu city [reached 240,000 apartments by 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1303257/south-korea-apartments-in-daegu-by-number-of-stories/#statisticContainer). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because Korean citizens are so busy, they do not have enough time to meet with potential buyers, many apartment unit owners entrust property agents with sales transactions. The significance of determining property values can help to simplify property buying and selling transactions. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1048638/south-korea-number-of-unsold-housings-daegu/) data, the number of properties in Daegu City that have not been sold by 2021 is 2000 property.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [ruhl and ruhl home web](https://www.ruhlhomes.com/selling-a-home/importance-to-price-right/#:~:text=Pricing%20your%20home%20at%20fair,sell%20at%20a%20lower%20price), pricing your property at a reasonable market value will attract potential buyers. The longer a property sits on the market, the lower its perceived value and the likelihood that it will be sold at a lower price. As a result, tools in an application are required to determine the estimated price of a property for property agent."

    "\n",
    "As the population in Daegu City increases, there will also be an increase in the need for housing, especially apartments in Daegu City. So that property agents must streamline the costs incurred to get maximum revenue.\n",

    "Based on research conducted by [Onur Demirci from the University of Westminster](https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/download/2dae110e45564422696a65c873989232ffbea0a3e58d318a552b963485e4452f/570796/Research%20Paper%20-%20Traditional%20and%20Mass%20%28Advanced%29%20Valuation%20Methods.pdf), valuation is a process that involves defining the fair market. When valuing a group of properties, it is widely acknowledged that traditional valuation has numerous limitations. value of an entity Traditional valuation methods have significant limitations in terms of accuracy, consistency, and speed.

With an increasing volume of transactions and a changing real estate market, advanced valuation (regression machine learning model) is becoming more applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that tools in the form of machine learning models that have been made will be used when apartment unit owners want to sell apartment units through property agents, then property agents will enter apartment unit specifications that issue price predictions of apartment units to be marketed. And I as a machine learning engineer from a property agent company will create and maintain the tools that have been created."

An outlier is an observation that appears far away and deviates from a sample's overall pattern. Outliers in input data can skew and mislead machine learning algorithms' training processes, resulting in longer training times, less accurate models, and ultimately poorer results."
